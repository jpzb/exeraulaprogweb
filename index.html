    <h1>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</h1>
    <h2>Beautiful is better than ugly.</h2>
    <h2>Explicit is better than implicit.</h2>
    <h2>Simple is better than complex.</h2>
    <h2>Complex is better than complicated.</h2>
    <h2>Flat is better than nested.</h2>
    <h2>Sparse is better than dense.</h2>
    <h2>Readability counts.</h2>
    <h2>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</h2>
    <h2>Although practicality beats purity.</h2>
    <h2>Errors should never pass silently.</h2>
    <h2>Unless explicitly silenced.</h2>
    <h2>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</h2>
    <h2>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</h2>
    <h2>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</h2>
    <h2>Now is better than never.</h2>
    <h2>Although never is often better than *right* now.</h2>
    <h2>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</h2>
    <h2>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</h2>
    <h2>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</h2>
